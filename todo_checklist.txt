# EXIF Tag Detection and Decoding - Feature Completeness Checklist
# Target: Achieve near 100% value matching with exiftool across all test files

## DRIVING REQUIREMENTS (MUST COMPLETE)
==========================================

1. ACHIEVE NEAR 100% VALUE MATCHING WITH EXIFTOOL
   - Current average match rate: ~32% across 37 test files
   - Target: 95%+ match rate for feature completeness
   - Focus on most common fields: ExifVersion, ISO, ExposureMode, FNumber, ExposureCompensation, ApertureValue, ShutterSpeedValue, FlashpixVersion, MaxApertureValue, FocalPlaneResolutionUnit

2. FIX ALL MAJOR EXIF FIELD FORMATTING ISSUES
   - Address all issues identified in correctness_checklist.txt
   - Ensure post-processing framework executes correctly
   - Produce exact matches with exiftool output format

3. SYSTEMATIC TESTING AND VALIDATION
   - Test all 37 files in test_files directory
   - Validate improvements across different file formats (CR2, HEIF, JPEG, MOV, MP4)
   - Ensure consistent behavior across camera manufacturers (Canon, Nikon, Apple, etc.)

## CRITICAL FIELD FIXES (HIGH PRIORITY)
=======================================

□ Fix version field ASCII conversion
   - CURRENT: Producing garbled output (d   , Ý   ) 
   - TARGET: Clean strings (0100, 0230)
   - ISSUE: Little-endian ASCII conversion logic needs refinement
   - FILES AFFECTED: 18+ files

□ Refine ExposureCompensation pattern matching
   - CURRENT: Showing -10 instead of 0
   - TARGET: Exact EV values (0, -1/3, -2/3, +1/3, +2/3)
   - ISSUE: Conversion formula needs adjustment
   - FILES AFFECTED: 16+ files

□ Complete ShutterSpeedValue APEX conversion
   - CURRENT: Raw values (964, 908, 878)
   - TARGET: Exact fractions (1/197, 1/512, 1/41)
   - ISSUE: APEX formula 2^(-apex_value) needs refinement
   - FILES AFFECTED: 13+ files

□ Fix ApertureValue APEX conversion
   - CURRENT: Incorrect values (5.0 instead of 5.7)
   - TARGET: Exact f-numbers matching exiftool
   - ISSUE: Formula 2^(apex_value/2) needs adjustment
   - FILES AFFECTED: 16+ files

□ Complete ExposureMode formatting
   - CURRENT: "Auto Exposure", "Manual Exposure"
   - TARGET: "Auto", "Manual"
   - ISSUE: String replacement logic needs completion
   - FILES AFFECTED: 17+ files

## FIELD-SPECIFIC ISSUES (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
=========================================

□ Fix Sharpness field
   - CURRENT: Showing "None" or missing
   - TARGET: Numeric values (3) or "Normal"
   - ISSUE: Field not being parsed or formatted correctly
   - FILES AFFECTED: Multiple files

□ Fix MeteringMode mapping
   - CURRENT: Value 5 shows "Evaluative"
   - TARGET: Value 5 should show "Multi-segment"
   - ISSUE: Mapping table needs correction
   - FILES AFFECTED: Multiple files

□ Fix string parsing issues
   - CURRENT: Make field showing "EGL" instead of "LGE"
   - TARGET: Correct manufacturer names
   - ISSUE: String parsing/endianness problems
   - FILES AFFECTED: Multiple files

□ Fix FocalPlaneResolutionUnit
   - CURRENT: Raw numeric values (6086.763070)
   - TARGET: Descriptive strings ("inches")
   - ISSUE: Unit conversion not implemented
   - FILES AFFECTED: 7+ files

□ Fix CustomRendered field
   - CURRENT: "Normal Process"
   - TARGET: "Normal"
   - ISSUE: String formatting needs adjustment
   - FILES AFFECTED: Multiple files

□ Fix Model field truncation
   - CURRENT: "RICOH THETA V   " (with trailing spaces)
   - TARGET: "RICOH THETA V" (clean)
   - ISSUE: String trimming needed
   - FILES AFFECTED: Multiple files

## MISSING/EXTRA FIELDS (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
=========================================

□ Add missing fields that exiftool provides
   - CURRENT: Some fields missing (e.g., Sharpness: 3)
   - TARGET: All exiftool fields present
   - ISSUE: Field detection/parsing gaps
   - ACTION: Identify and implement missing field parsing

□ Remove extra fields that fast-exif-rs provides but exiftool does not
   - CURRENT: Extra computed fields
   - TARGET: Only fields that exiftool provides
   - ISSUE: Over-generous field addition
   - ACTION: Audit and remove unnecessary fields

## SYSTEM IMPROVEMENTS (LOWER PRIORITY)
=======================================

□ Optimize post-processing performance
   - CURRENT: Post-processing adds overhead
   - TARGET: Minimal performance impact
   - ISSUE: Efficiency optimization needed
   - ACTION: Profile and optimize conversion functions

□ Add comprehensive error handling
   - CURRENT: Basic error handling
   - TARGET: Robust edge case handling
   - ISSUE: Edge cases may cause failures
   - ACTION: Add try-catch and fallback logic

□ Document all field conversion logic
   - CURRENT: Limited documentation
   - TARGET: Complete conversion documentation
   - ISSUE: Maintenance and debugging difficulty
   - ACTION: Document formulas and mappings

□ Create automated regression tests
   - CURRENT: Manual testing only
   - TARGET: Automated compatibility testing
   - ISSUE: Risk of regressions
   - ACTION: Implement automated test suite

## TESTING AND VALIDATION (ONGOING)
===================================

□ Test all 37 files in test_files directory
   - CURRENT: Partial testing
   - TARGET: Complete coverage
   - ACTION: Run comprehensive_exif_test.py on all files

□ Validate improvements across file formats
   - CR2 (Canon RAW): 10+ files
   - HEIF (Apple): 8+ files  
   - JPEG: 5+ files
   - MOV/MP4: 5+ files
   - Other formats: 9+ files

□ Ensure consistent behavior across camera manufacturers
   - Canon: CR2 files
   - Apple: HEIF files
   - Nikon: NEF files
   - Other manufacturers: Various formats

## SUCCESS METRICS
==================

□ Average match rate: 95%+ (currently ~32%)
□ Critical fields match rate: 98%+ (ExifVersion, ISO, ExposureMode, FNumber, ExposureCompensation)
□ APEX conversion accuracy: 95%+ (ShutterSpeedValue, ApertureValue)
□ Version field accuracy: 100% (FlashpixVersion, ExifVersion)
□ String field accuracy: 95%+ (Make, Model, ExposureMode)

## NOTES
=======

- Post-processing framework is now executing (confirmed by debug output)
- Version field conversion is working but producing garbled output
- ExposureCompensation conversion is working but needs refinement
- APEX conversions are partially implemented
- Focus should be on refining existing logic rather than major architectural changes
